# [Exploring Archetypes Through Characters in a Mysterious Time and Place](https://chat.openai.com/c/afb2defa-b73c-47ed-8ad7-bb9934234fd8)

### Overview of Archetype Structure
- **Exploring Timeless and Culturally-dependent Archetypes in a Pre-Columbian Setting During a Devastating Pandemic**
	- **Key Point**: Blending Jungian archetypes with an innovative gender approach in a culturally ambiguous setting, while maintaining a contemporary tone in dialogue to encourage relatability with characters.
### The Setting's Significance
- **Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica: A Blank Canvas for Culturally-dependent Archetypes**
	- **Cultural Ambiguity**: Limited historical knowledge allows creative freedom.
	- **Timeless Backdrop**: Ideal for exploring universal human themes and timeless archetypes of the collective unconscious.
	- **Gender Exploration**: A setting where gender roles can be reimagined.
### Gender-Neutral Character Approach
- **Redefining Gender in Storytelling**
    - **Unspecified Genders**: Characters’ genders are never revealed.
    - **Encourages Projection**: Readers interpret characters based on personal perspectives, perhaps providing insight into their own Shadow.
    - **Cultural Neutrality**: Avoids contemporary and historical gender biases.
### Jungian-ish Archetypes in the Narrative
- **Tapping into the Collective Unconscious**
	- **The Tragic Hero(ine) / The Fallen Star / The Lost Beacon**: The city itself as an Oedipal tragedy.
	- **The Visionary Ruler / The Trailblazer / The Architect**: Embodiment of a drive for technological progress.
    - **The Wise Elder / The Sage / The Seer**: Embodiment of wisdom and foresight.
    - **The Nature Guardian / The Caretaker / The Nurturer**: Protector and nurturer of the natural world.
    - **The Athlete / The Warrior / The Competitor**: Symbol of physical prowess and competition.
    - **The Industrious Artisan / The Craftsman / The Creator**: Fusion of creativity and skill in craftsmanship.
    - **The Outsider Family / The Explorers / The Diplomats**: Bringers of new perspectives and change.
    - **The Orphan / The Survivor / The Innocent**: Inspiring hope through innocence and resilience amidst change.
### Impact of Archetype Approach

- **Deepening the Narrative Through Archetypes**
    - **Enhanced Reader Engagement**: Invites diverse interpretations and connections.
    - **Universal Themes**: Explores human experiences beyond cultural confines.
    - **Reflective Storytelling**: Encourages introspection about identity and roles.

# [Four Storylines (Horsemen of the Apocalypse)](https://chat.openai.com/c/8d2ff13f-1c94-48d1-a16b-991897290f59)

### Convergence at the Climax
- **Intersection of Storylines**: These independent storylines intersect as the city reaches its breaking point, a point of collective psychological awakening.
- **The Orphan's Role**: The Orphan, as a symbol of innocence and future hope, becomes a pivotal figure in the climax, possibly being the one to unite the surviving characters.
### The Tragic Hero(ine) / The Fallen Star / The Lost Beacon and The Visionary Ruler / The Trailblazer / The Architect
- **Oedipal Tragedy & Inevitable Downfall (Conquest)**: Echoing "Oedipus Rex," the city, led by the Visionary Leader, is marked by a tragic fate, with its initial prosperity and blindness to environmental and societal consequences leading to an inevitable downfall. **Mastery of control is a fool's errand** (hello Jurassic Park). Ruler reflects on their blind spots and how their need for control or approval ultimately leads to their downfall (epiphany awe just before death?).
- **Challenges – Ecological and Societal**: The city's aggressive advancements lead to ecological imbalances and societal strains, culminating in a devastating plague that acts as the final catalyst for its downfall.
- **"Character" Development – Rise and Fall**: The city's growth and subsequent collapse encompass the rise and fall of the Visionary Leader. In a poignant twist, the city's own creations (its structures, systems, or environmental disruptions) play a direct role in the leader's demise, symbolically representing the city destroying its own visionary, thereby completing its Oedipal arc.
### The Wise Elder / The Sage / The Seer and The Nature Guardian / The Caretaker / The Nurturer
- **Moral Adventure Theme (Famine)**: Inspired by "National Treasure" and "The Da Vinci Code", their storyline involves deciphering ancient temple inscriptions and navigating forgotten ruins to find a legendary medicinal plant believed to cure the plague. **Empathetic service is a core tenant of humanity, and straying from it leads to moral famine.**
- **Challenges**: They face physical and intellectual challenges, including solving riddles and overcoming dangerous traps, which test their wisdom and respect for nature.
- **Character Development**: Their journey deepens their bond and highlights the contrast between traditional wisdom (Wise Elder) and a deep connection to nature (Nature Guardian). As they seek the medicinal plant, they develop their realization of the importance of empathetic service and staying true to one's core values, rather than succumbing to societal expectations or fears.

### The Athlete / The Warrior / The Competitor and The Industrious Artisan / The Craftsman / The Creator
- **Story of Struggle (War)**: The Athlete, a symbol of the city’s glory in sports and entertainment, and the Artisan, representing creativity and innovation, initially find themselves at odds, embodying the city's conflicting values. The narrative will need to carefully tread the jock-geek trope line, as that will likely cause the characters to deviate from a neutral gender. **Established Tradition and Innovation are by nature in conflict.**
- **Shared Challenges**: As the plague worsens, they are forced to cooperate, facing issues like resource scarcity, social unrest, and personal loss.
- **Emerging Unity**: Their storyline illustrates how different facets of society must come together in times of crisis, learning from each other and working towards a common goal. The initial conflict between the Athlete and Artisan can be a backdrop for exploring themes of power dynamics.

### The Outsider Family / The Explorers / The Diplomats and The Orphan / The Survivor / The Innocent
- **Background (Death)**: The Outsider family, possibly traders or diplomats, arrive in the city before the outbreak, bringing tales and perspectives from the outside world. **Freedom comes with the risk of death, while safety flirts with the risk of losing life's essence.**
- **Tragic Turn**: The family could unknowingly carry the disease, which leads to the outbreak. This tragic irony adds depth to the narrative.
- **The Birth of the Orphan**: As the plague ravages the city, the family falls victim, leaving the child as an orphan (or maybe it's not explicitly stated they were the parents). This child's journey of survival and adaptation symbolizes innocence amidst chaos.

### Conclusion
- **Resolution**: The narrative concludes with the disparate characters coming together, forming a new, albeit smaller, community that represents the hope for a better future.
- **The New Family Unit**: The Industrious Artisan / The Craftsman / The Creator, The Nature Guardian / The Caretaker / The Nurturer, and The Orphan / The Survivor / The Innocent form a new family unit, symbolizing the amalgamation of different societal elements, an end to Conquest, and the potential for rebuilding in harmony with nature and each other.

# [Some Themes to Sort Out](https://chat.openai.com/c/afb2defa-b73c-47ed-8ad7-bb9934234fd8)

### Primary Theme: Betrayal by the Gods

- **Contextual Setup**: Establish a society deeply rooted in its faith and rituals, where the gods play a central role in guiding and protecting the people.
- **Inciting Incident**: Introduce a pivotal event or series of events that are perceived as the gods betraying the society – a failed prophecy and plague.
### Stoic and Viktor Frankl’s Perspectives

- **Internal Power**: Emphasize the Stoic belief in the power of the individual’s will and perspective. Despite the gods' betrayal, characters find strength in their ability to choose their reactions and maintain hope.
- **Meaning in Suffering**: Inspired by Frankl, characters discover that meaning can be found even in suffering, and that this meaning provides the *opportunity* to endure and grow from their experiences. Considering the circumstances an opportunity encourages a positive, forward-looking mindset of gratitude and finding something to live for.
### The Allegory: Navigating the Grief of Betrayal through the Eight Archetypes with the [Eight Categories of Awe](https://www.amazon.com/Awe-Science-Everyday-Wonder-Transform/dp/1984879707/)
#### Awe serves as the mechanism for character growth
1. **Moral Beauty (Warrior)**: Characters find strength in acts of kindness and moral courage within the community, even when the gods seem absent. Warrior's growth through awe leads to self-sacrifice.
2. **Collective Effervescence (Creator)**: Shared experiences, like community rituals or gatherings, help the characters feel connected and resilient in the face of divine betrayal. Creator's growth through awe leads to a newfound appreciation for community.
3. **Nature (Hero)**: Reconnecting with the awe of the natural world as a source of healing and perspective, independent of the gods. Hero's "growth through awe" is a return to alignment with nature.
4. **Music (Seer)**: Using music as a means of expression, solace, and communal bonding, transcending their sense of abandonment. The drum beats. Seer's growth through awe is an acceptance of mortality and drive to pass on wisdom.
5. **Visual Design (Ruler/Explorers)**: Characters find  solace and meaning in the beauty of their art and architecture, reminders of human potential and creativity. Ruler's growth through awe is a newfound appreciation for the humanity in art.
6. **Spirituality and Religion (Caretaker)**: Exploring personal spirituality that diverges from traditional religious practices, finding inner peace and understanding. Caretaker's growth through awe is a newfound respect and acceptance for the mysterious and unknown.
7. **Life and Death (Orphan)**: A profound engagement with the life-death cycle, finding awe in the natural process of existence, beyond the realm of the gods. Orphan's growth through awe is a coming of age.
8. **Epiphany (Explorers/Ruler)**: Characters experience moments of profound insight, leading to personal growth and a deeper understanding of their situation. Explorers' growth is a newfound appreciation for sacrificing some freedom of exploration for devoting more time to a home and community.
### Integration in the Narrative

- **Character Development**: Each character’s journey can be aligned with one or more categories of awe, showcasing their unique ways of coping with the perceived betrayal.
- **Societal Reflection**: The society as a whole grapples with these themes, with different groups or leaders embodying various reactions to the betrayal – some stoic, some despairing, others finding new paths.
- **Climax and Resolution**: The climax can revolve around a pivotal moment of collective or individual awakening, leading to a resolution that reflects the society’s adaptation or transformation in response to their changed relationship with the gods.

### Other Themes to Potentially Weave In

- **Environmental Harmony vs. Technological Progress**: The balance and conflict between advancements in agriculture, water management, and metalworking, and their impact on the natural world.

- **The Tragic Hero Archetype**: Drawing from "Oedipus Rex," the portrayal of the city and its society as a tragic hero, with inherent flaws leading to an inevitable downfall.

- **Reverence for Water**: Integrating the 'Blue Mind' concept and pre-Columbian respect for water, highlighting its role in the society's spiritual and daily life, and its eventual misuse.

- **Authenticity and Personal Fulfillment**: The importance of staying true to one's values and character for personal happiness and healthy relationships.
	- Reflecting the concept of 'Quality' from "Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance" 
	- [Some lyrics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBTIe308kPo) that reflect the struggle for authenticity:
		- "Seize my head in regret  
			There might not be another vision
			One that makes me forget I wish I was another person
			And we still  
			Try every night to go make sense of it
			(Fighting)"

- **Struggle Against Tradition (Human Sacrifice)**: Introducing a counter-narrative to the traditional view of human sacrifice in pre-Columbian societies, exploring the internal and societal conflicts arising from challenging deeply ingrained practices.

- **Connection and Disconnection from Nature**: How the society's advancements lead to a growing disconnection from nature, paralleling modern environmental issues.

- **Ritual Sports as a Reflection of Society**: The role of ritual sports in reflecting and influencing societal values, from unity and celebration to competition and aggression.


## To Do
- Determine narrative technique - considering multiple narrator accounts to focus on multiple internal dialogues and encourage reader projection
	- [As I Lay Dying - William Faulkner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/As_I_Lay_Dying)
	- [The Poisonwood Bible - Barbara Kingsolver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Poisonwood_Bible)
- Nail down some final symbols, such as the Owl, Fog, etc.
- The details of the storylines' convergence at the story's climax.
- The details of the "epilogue", or the creating of The Cache and the return to nature, the whole inspiration behind this story.
- Outline of scenes for each storyline, their purposes for the theme and plot, and their order.

Ologies with Alie Ward
Ethnoecology (ETHNOBOTANY/NATIVE PLANTS) with Leigh Joseph

Description
This episode explores the field of ethnobotany and its importance in renewing traditional knowledge of plant foods and medicine within Indigenous communities. The guest shares her personal journey as an ethnobotanist and discusses topics such as identifying plants, historical influences on plant usage, ceremonial plants, harvesting practices, invasive weeds, and skin remedies. She also highlights the need for more indigenous voices in the field and emphasizes the importance of respecting cultural and spiritual significance associated with certain plants.

Insights
Ethnobotany as a Pathway to Reconnecting with Indigenous Roots
Studying ethnobotany has provided the guest with a pathway to reconnecting with her indigenous roots and passing on land-based knowledge to her children. However, she has also faced challenges due to the impacts of colonization and residential schools.

The Importance of Culturally-Appropriate Research
The guest emphasizes the importance of conducting culturally-appropriate research in ethnobotany, which involves engaging with indigenous communities, collaborating with existing experts, and ensuring responsible harvesting practices.

The Controversy Surrounding Native Plants and Cultivation
Native plants and cultivars are a controversial topic within the plant society. It is important to consider the origins of the seed or plant being planted and to focus on enhancing growth and productivity rather than adjusting aspects like foliage color or disease resistance.

The Medicinal Properties of Native Plants
Native plants have a wide range of medicinal properties, including anti-inflammatory, wound healing, and analgesic effects. However, caution should be exercised when incorporating native plant medicines alongside prescription medicines due to the lack of literature understanding about contraindications.

Balancing Traditional Knowledge and Scientific Studies
When reintroducing remedies from indigenous practices into modern times, it is important to strike a balance between traditional knowledge and scientific studies. This ensures that the cultural significance of traditional practices is respected while also benefiting from scientific advancements.
