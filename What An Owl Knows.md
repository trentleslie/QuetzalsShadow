"The Iroquois of North America interpret an owl calling nearby as a signal that they should gather wood against imminent cold and snow "Something similar was also present in field cases in southern Chile," says Tomás Ibarra, a human ecologist at Pontificia Universidad Católica in Chile. One individual who was interviewed said that when a barn owl cried during the night in the hot season, "it would dawn with dense mist, and it did, it was like a barometer that we had."

In the Tenejapa region of Chiapas in southern Mexico, the Mottled Owl is known as mutil balam, "bird of the jaguar," or mutil coh (choj). "bird of the cougar," and its appearance suggests the big cats are close For the Apurinã people of Brazil, the call of the caburé owl, the Fer- ruginous Pygmy Owl, indicates that peccaries are nearby. If the owl is silent, hunters will remain at home.

These "folkloric" views of owls as natural signs may seem quaint. but they're often rooted in real natural history observations. In many cases, the "reading" of owls is related to a sophisticated understanding of ecological relationships, and the birds may well be providing essen tial information about the environment.""
